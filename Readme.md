My first Javascript solo project!

I will be creating a HTML Sheet with 3 buttons and a text output field, a reset button
Also a CSS stylesheet and styling the code very well!!

Javascript will be hopefully up to date with new practices and clean code!

Will come back and write a tutorial for it when I'am done.

Thanks
